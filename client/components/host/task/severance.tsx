          Psst! I heard a rumor that our coworker Jimmy got let go last Friday. We don&apos;t know much about Jimmyâ€¦ He&apos;s always kept to himself and never attended the team-bonding events. I wonder what he did to get fired.

          Give some context to the firing of Jimmy. What did he really do to get fired?
